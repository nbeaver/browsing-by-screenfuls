I read a lot of documents on LCD computer screens.

PDFs are annoying to read on most displays,
since the PDF is usually a letter size portrait orientation,
whereas most displays are landscape orientation.

PDFs also can't be reflowed and waste a lot of space in the margins,
which makes them almost unreadable on small or narrow screens.
</p>

<p>
HTML rendered in a browser, however,
can reflow to fill whatever screen it's displayed on,
and with proper use of CSS can be made readable on any display.

You can change the font,
resize the text,
even change the CSS if you want.

HTML is flexible and continuous
in a way that PDFs aren't
and were never meant to be.
</p>

<p>
HTML also tends to be better for skimming a document.

If I hold down the Page Down key in Adobe Acrobat Readerâ„¢ on a long PDF,
the pages don't stop coming after I release the key;
I asked for that many pages and by George I'll get them,
even if it takes several minutes to load pages I didn't want to see.

By then I've lost my place and I have to go find it again somehow.

(This issue is mostly a feature of Adobe's PDF reader, by the way;
open-source PDF readers like Evince don't generally have this issue
unless the PDF is very image-heavy or otherwise renders slowly.)
</p>

<p>
when HTML doesn't fit one one screenful,
most people scroll to see the rest of the page,
which used to require clicking and dragging on the scroll bar,
but is easier now that we have touch screens and scroll wheels on mice.

Scrolling is hard on the eyes because it takes a lot of effort to track moving text.
It's also slow; that's one reason why we invented the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex">paginated codex</a>
in the first place.

Browser developers know this;
that's why the spacebar and Page Down keys both move down the page by one screenful.
</p>

<button onclick="alert(windowVals())">Window values</button> 

<p>
Reading by screenfuls is a natural way to read documents.
I love the page down capability,
because it is similar to reading a book,
but keeps some continuity between 'pages'.

The text stays still until I get the bottom of the screen,
then I page down and flick my eyes up to the top of the screen.

Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a problem with reading HTML
that is a result of browser implementation,
not intrinsic to the format.

Suppose I am reading an HTML page that is a screenful and a half long.

When I page down, the browser will not move the bottom line of text to the top of the screen.

Instead, it will put the end of the document at the bottom of the screen,
ignoring any attempt at continuity.

I think of this as 'bottoming out',
since it gives a jarring sensation when reading reminiscent of
a car's suspension dipping down too far and smacking into the dirt.

PDF documents have to do this because they must preserve the typographical layout,
but webpages have no reason to break the flow of reading at the end.
</p>

<p>
Contrast this with moving forward a screenful in text editors like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
(<code>C-v</code>)
or
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
(<code>C-f</code>).
They move the line at the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen,
regardless of how many lines the file happens to be.
Emacs adds some unreachable blank space at the bottom,
and Vim puts cute little tildes to show you're past the end of the document,
like this:<br>
~<br>
~<br>
~<br>
The venerable Unix terminal pager
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/less/"><code>less</code></a>
calls this <code>forw-screen-force</code>,
which is mapped to <code>Esc-Space</code> by default;
the manual page notes this command
"scrolls a full screenful, even if it reaches end-of-file in the process."
</p>

<button onclick="alert(windowVals())">Window values</button> 

<p>
I put up with this when I didn't know any better, but after using Vim I
realized how annoying this phenomenon is, especially on websites that consist
of one article chopped into 10 different pieces so that they can put more
banner ads at the top. I use Firefox addons to combat both
<a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">irritating ads</a>
and
<a href="http://www.teesoft.info/">pagination</a>,
but there's nothing I can do about bottoming out on the last screenful. I
resigned myself to inferior browsing, since nobody seemed to notice or care
enough to fix it.
</p>

<p>

<!-- TODO: change this to reStructuredText and just link to the demo page. -->
Until now: see the results of my experiment on the demo page: 

improve the guessing how many lines are necessary; currently I just assume 10
will be enough. You will notice that if this document flows to betweeen 1 and 2
screenfuls, there will automatically be padding; this is because the onscroll
event fires after the scrolling takes place, so the tildes are actually added
before you even press the PgDn button.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, website designers are aware of this issue, and put links related
pages or some other form of footer on the bottom of the page; not necessarily
enough to solve the problem, but enough to show an awareness of the issue.
Another solution, called "Infinite Scroll", is becoming popular, though in
practice it's not used for single article-style pages and it seldom loads
quickly enough to completely prevent bottoming out.
</p>

<p>
What web designers seem less aware of is the problems introduced by fixed
headers, most of which use the css nav-fixed class. Even Ars Technica does
this, and while Firefox
<a href='https://bugzil.la/780345'>has fixed it in the latest version</a>,
I suspect there will always be some issues with it.
<!-- Bug description: "Page down scrolls too far on pages with fixed header elements (page size is miscalculated)"-->
Because this problem isn't going away, I am tremendously grateful for tools like the
<a href="http://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/2013/05/29/kill-sticky-headers.html">Kill Sticky</a>
bookmarklet.
